# TP: ALBWStyleMeter
A "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess" mod that modifies the mechanics of several items to utilize a meter similarly to how they do/could in "A Link Between Worlds", a 3DS Zelda game.

## Modified items:

* Lantern: consumes meter faster.
* Slingshot: each shot consumes 1/4 off the meter.
* Bow: each shot consumes 1/4 off the meter.
* Normal and Water Bombs: consumes 1/3 off the meter.
* Bomblings: can not be used at all. (The code is not decompiled enough to integrate properly with the meter afaik.)
* Bomb Arrows:
