# TP: ALBWStyleMeter
A "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess" mod that modifies the mechanics of several items to utilize a meter similarly to how they do/could in "A Link Between Worlds", a 3DS Zelda game.

## Modified items:

* Lantern: consumes meter faster.
* Slingshot: each shot consumes 1/4 off the meter.
* Bow: each shot consumes 1/4 off the meter.
* Normal and Water Bombs: consumes 1/3 off the meter.
* Bomblings: can not be used at all. (The code is not decompiled enough to integrate properly with the meter afaik.)
* Bomb Arrows: each shot consumes 7/12 off the meter.
* Magic Armor: Consumes meter when worn. Still lose rupees when hit. (The code for rupee loss when hit may not be fully decompiled atm.)
* Spinner: consumes meter when on rails and when attacking/jumping.
* Dominion Rod: consumes meter when swung, when controlling object, and when attacking with controlled object.

## Extra features:

* Toggle bewtween Kokiri, Zora, and Magic armor by pressing Dpad-down. (Must unlock armor to toggle.)
   * Kokiri/Armor->Zora Armor: press Dpad-down once.
   * Kokiri/Zora->Armor: press Dpad-down twice.
   * Zora->Kokiri: press Dpad-down once.
   * Armor->Kokiri: press Dpad-down twice.
